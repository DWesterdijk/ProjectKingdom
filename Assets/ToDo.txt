Move function
	The player(s) can move around the map on tiles, they can only move X steps from their starting point of the current turn.
	X being the amount rolled on the dice + additional bonuses.
	Their current position is where they last landed on.

Step count
	The step count keeps track of the amount of steps a player can make and has made.

Encounter panels
	if the player(s) land on this tile an encounter will happen. The encounters will be random per region.
